11_1     -  type 'Vodafone post -  And’
                                                            we get two entries for andhra Pradesh - add them
                                                           type 'Vodafone post - Bih'
                                                            we get two entries for bihar - add them
                                                           clear the text in the search window
                                                            you will notice two more entries for 'ASSAM' also added!
                                                             OR
                                                           type 'Vodafone post - Delh'
                                                            add two entries for Delhi (note while adding, button does not seem to work on all the clicks but you see the merchant numbers decrementing - i think that is the clue)
                                                            you see many entries other than Delhi also.
                                                         ALMOST SIMILAR THING HAPPENS with FEATURE ADDITION
                                               PS:I think this is the work in progress, but logging so we could track the issue.
 - > We are already tracking this defect
 
11_2 modify group by same user (before being verified) fails at the last step  (after modifying the features/merchants and clicking ‘modify’)- could stop in the beginning itself.
- > We are already tracking this defect

11_3  verify group interface not consistent: the featulist tab does not have ‘sl.no’ but the merchants list has.
                                              Also in the Configs tab we see the following listing.
      
                                                                                                                                ref3                                        ref3

                                                                                                                                ref6                                        ref6

 -> We will track it on jira and we will make it consistent
 
11_4 modify group should allow only change of AccountManager
                                                          go to modify group, do not change features or the merchants, but only modify account manager. Errors out " Cannot do that. You have to change atleast one merchant and feature". We should allow  change of groupAccountManager.

->We will track it on Jira
 
11_5 modify group deleted the entries!!! - Modified Bigmerchant tne Voda_postpaid as superadmn1. They are not seen any more!. please check in the backend.
 
-> I am really sorry, not able to understand the defect thoroughly. Kindly elaborate please.

TRAFFIC
------------
 
Refreshed time:
a)In traffic page, device page :Last Refreshed May 30 23:34 (always)
b)not shown in payment Type page
 
UI - extra rectangle - small rectangular crossed box appears with amounts- related to licence?
 
The icons for 'Partial outage, Fluctuation, Outage' not showing up. we always get a crossed circle. This is seen only in today's build.
 
In the graph download page the request time has '+5.30'
 
In traffic report (for today) - at 14.20 - the times show till 22.00 hours
 
In traffic report (for today) - at 14.20 The values seen on in the report for avarage transaction - 2303, On the graph 2452. The amount and count are OK.
 
In traffic report (last week) - are we supposed to show only the daily report - we have the daily graph downloaded. DISCUSS.
 
Report request time :'2015-05-15T16:34:06.249+05:30'  can be made more readable - seconds may not have decimal., could have space between date,time
 
‘request id’ is shown in the downloads page - same can be displayed in the success page, "The Request ID is …”
 
The 'total amount' field in the report traffic report is highlighted.
 
design question: The reports for download : will they be available for all the users of the group or only the user who has requested?
 
Payment Type:
-------------------
 
The percentage values - in horizontal bar chart are looking too feeble
 
'Others' being expandable is not indicative. yes we have made it hyperlink, but still not indicative.  label itself can be 'Others- more?' 
     - on clicking the button says [Back to] -> this could simply be [Back]. Is it highcharts stuff?
 
click on DebitCards - only alternate columns are used. Further on clicking 'Others' nothing happens.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

screen shot for 'Small Rectangles' in collections GUI - on my laptop - see the amount column 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Add User:
---------------
screen – right side top tab not aligned with the contents section
 
setAccesstime - remains always RED in spite of editing all the fields (start time, end time, IP) - fails with the following
 
"           User Not Added
Sorry, could not cater to your request. "
-Correct error to be displayed
 
Consistency across success and failure popups – need to have all success and failure messages consistent.
 
Examples:
"              Success!
 
        User Added Successfully        "
 
"               Failure!
 
  User not added. Please set IP address correctly "
 
"               Success!
 
     Group modified Successfully "
 
"                  Failure!
 
  User not added. Duplicate emailID! "
                 
"                  Failure!
 
  Reset Password Unsuccessful. Email service not working"
             
user registration
-----------------------
 
- the page can be bit wider
- Top text to read "Please enter the following details to activate your account"
- Name(label) to be replaced with 'First Name' 'Last Name'
- password strength indicator
  enter bill333   indicator says 'OK' but on clicking says 'must be 8 characters'.  The strength  indicator should cater to password specs.
 
- the password recommendations to be added here as well
 
- enter a wrong OTP - message
 
"           Failed
            null           "
 
- click send OTP button - message
 
"          Success
             null          "
 
The same above message appears on entering the correct OTP and clicking "Activate My Account"
 
Message should be "Thank you. You have successfully verfied your account details .....' (I guess we have finalized on this message earlier, else
please let me know) and redirect to login page.
 
 
On a side note, tried to deploy the war on tomcat; deployment fails with following errors:

try to login at a date/time not permitted;
error says "You can not login now" -> "You can not login now as per the Billdesk access policy"
 
 
create group
  just add groupname and ID ->
                          says
"       At Lest one feature and merchant!
 
        You have:0features,0 merchants      "   to be refined "Select Atleast One Feature" or "Select Atleast one Merchant" depending on the case.
 
 
delete a just created group (before verify)
         The state changes to  "REJECTED" and button options change from "VIEW/DELETE" to "VIEW/MODIFY/DELETE"
         repeated actions of delete says " Group Modified Successfully" but actually does not delete the group
 
try to create a group without selecting query feature
 
"        Select a Query Feature
 
"   Select one of query featuress you need to grant"  -> " Select the query feature to be assigned"
 
 
entry remains after verify: verify the group newly created, the entry should go away; it remains. (this is not consistent though)
                            but if I reject the entry goes off: (but in the VIEW menu of superadmin1 it still says "ACTIVE" "VIEW" ?)               
  
 
view of admin user does not have a 'X' button
 
 
modify user flow says "sending reset link" before invoking modify !
 
 
password changes
---------------
 
when passwords are not matching
 
"       No Match!
 
     "   ->
 
"            Failure!
  New Passwords must match! "
 
 
when old password is wrong still goes through and says - "success" . But old password is still valid; no change has occurred.
 
 
:profile has start and endtimes but not access days:
 
 
clicking "Reset Password" link - "Are you sure?This user's account will be locked and their password will be reset." ->
                                 "Are you sure? This user's account will be locked and the password reset request will be sent." [q: R we locking
account while password is getting changed?]
 
tags -> category - still to be done in some pages : example view admin user (note this popup also does not have an 'X' button)
 
 
modify Admin user - change of access days does not get reflected correctly.
                    do modify 'access days'-repeatedly and the changes are not reflected sometimes (almost 50%times)
 
 
Modify user and modify Admin user not consistent:
 
   1) modify Admin user screen displays internal IDs UID_11 etc., not required.
      other fields are: Name, email, status and VIEW button
 
   2)modify user (second screen listing users) diaplays: email, Status and View Button
                                               Need to add 'Name' in this screen
 
user verification page: does not redirect correctly to the Billdesk site.
 
 
just before opening the verification page there is small splash screen - to be removed
 
 
modify group - change admin - always logs out with session time out
